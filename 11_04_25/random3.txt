Title: Hacked Love

[FADE IN]

INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY

We see JACK, a nerdy hacker in his late 20s, sitting on his couch and typing away on his laptop. His roommate, MIKE, enters the room.

MIKE: Hey man, what's up? You've been typing away for hours.

JACK: (not looking up from his laptop) I think I just found my soulmate.

MIKE: (sarcastic) Oh yeah? Did you hack into her heart?

JACK: (smiling) Actually, I hacked into her wifi network and found her IP address 217.157.228.241.

MIKE: (laughing) And you call that romance?

JACK: (serious) I traced her email and phone number savalevanton@germemembranlar.com and 202-918-2132. I'm about to call her and set up a date.

MIKE: (impressed) Wow, you're really committed to this.

Suddenly, Jack's laptop beeps, and he looks at the screen.

JACK: (alarmed) Uh oh. I just got hit by a malware attack.

MIKE: (concerned) What does that mean?

JACK: (frustrated) It means I have to pay between $10.45 and $182.82 to get rid of it.

MIKE: (laughing) That's what you get for hacking into someone's network.

JACK: (sighing) Yeah, I guess I deserve it.

MIKE: (trying to cheer him up) Don't worry man, you'll find another girl to hack into.

JACK: (smiling) Thanks for the encouragement.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 2023-07-14 07:30 PM

We see Jack and the CUTE GIRL, sitting across from each other at a table. They are both dressed nicely, and there are candles on the table.

CUTE GIRL: (smiling) So, how did you find me?

JACK: (nervous) Well, I was just hacking into wifi networks, and I saw your IP address.

CUTE GIRL: (surprised) That's kind of creepy.

JACK: (trying to explain) I know it sounds weird, but I just wanted to get to know you.

CUTE GIRL: (smiling) Well, you could have just asked for my number.

JACK: (laughing) Yeah, I guess I could have.

They continue to talk and enjoy their meal. Suddenly, Jack's phone rings, and he looks at the screen.

JACK: (frustrated) Oh no, it's my bank. They're telling me that my credit card has been hacked.

CUTE GIRL: (concerned) That's terrible. Is there anything I can do to help?

JACK: (smiling) Actually, there is. Can you lend me some money to pay for dinner?

CUTE GIRL: (laughing) Sure, how much do you need?

JACK: (looking at his phone) $182.82.

CUTE GIRL: (smiling) Wow, you really know how to pick an expensive restaurant.

They both laugh, and Jack feels a sense of relief that the girl he hacked into is also someone he can have fun with.
